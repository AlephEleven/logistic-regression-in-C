# logistic-regression-in-C

Simple matrix library for handling 1d arrays as 2d matrices and vectors via [Row-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order).

## Features

* Pseudo-random generator for gaussian distributed numbers
* Matrix object for handling data, and shape+size properties
* Tools for applying linear algebra techniques such as matrix multplication, transpose, addition, elementwise functions
* Logistic Regression model that takes input data and weights+biases
* Model includes debug for each epoch


## Example: Binary Iris Dataset
